## 📊 Credit Score Analysis
This document presents my analysis of wallet behaviors after generating credit scores based on Aave V2 transaction data.
The scores range from 0 to 1000, where higher values indicate more trustworthy, responsible DeFi participants, and lower values suggest potentially risky or abnormal usage patterns.

## 🎯 Score Distribution (in 100-point bins)
Wallets were binned into the following score ranges:

|Score Range|	Number of Wallets |
|-----------|-------------------|
0–99	      | 10
100–199	    | 25
200–299	    | 25
300–399	    | 39
400–499	    | 53
500–599	    | 101
600–699	    | 123
700–799	    | 177
800–899	    | 421
900–999	    | 2523
1000–1099   | 0

## 🟢 Behavior of Wallets in the 900–1000 Range
These wallets scored the highest and exhibited the most consistent, trustworthy behaviors:

✅ Frequent deposits, often involving stablecoins like USDC or diversified tokens.

✅ Balanced borrow-repay cycles with responsible ratio management.

✅ No liquidation events in most cases.

✅ Transactions spread over longer timeframes (longer active duration).

✅ Engaged in multiple types of actions: deposit, borrow, repay, and redeem.

These users are highly reliable and may be well-suited for privileges like lower collateral ratios, governance roles, or credit delegation.

## 🔴 Behavior of Wallets in the 0–300 Range
Low-scoring wallets displayed riskier, inconsistent, or anomalous behavior:

❌ Few or single-use transactions.

❌ Disproportionate borrowing with no follow-up repayment.

❌ Early or immediate liquidation events.

❌ Bot-like behavior (e.g., flash deposits/redeems).

❌ Highly skewed activity — focusing only on one asset or action.

These wallets are potentially exploitative, opportunistic, or inactive and may not warrant incentivization or protocol-level trust.
